# Schrodinger-Solved
The code helps in solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation, in particular finding the eigenvalues of a particle in a given potential. The eigenvalues of the  full-harmonic oscillator and the half-harmonic oscillator has been found using the Hermite polynomials and the sine functions as orthogonal functions repectively. The details of the calculation can be seen in the pdf uploaded.
